    <p class="my-class">Values and principles guiding Sean's manifestation of happiness:</p>

    <ul>
      <li class="my-class2">Surround myself with the right people</li>
      <li class="my-class2">Do what I love</li>
      <li class="my-class2">Show gratitude each and every day</li>
      <li class="my-class2">listen to music</li>
      <li class="my-class2">Visualize my wants as if I already have them</li>
      <li class="my-class2">Type out my affirmations</li>
      <li class="my-class2">Take risks</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="my-class">Surrounding yourself with the right people has to be one of the most important principles. With having negative people always doubting you and telling you can't do something, or peopke making you lose your focus on the important things, how do you expect to succeed? At this point if they aren't the right people they will change your goals from continuously improving, to just proving them wrong. Once you've proved them wrong you will just be at a point in your life of no direction.</p>
    <p class="my-class">Doing what you love is important because if you're in a job that you don't love and wish you had better, but aren't doing anything to change that then you'll regret wasting your time. Also it will make things like coming home to your family unenjoyable for you and them. Wouldn't you rather like to come home and be able to brag about the day you had, and your accomplishments you achieved?</p>
    <p class="my-class">Showing gratitude isn't only good for you, but good for everyone around you. Don't take advantage of the people we have in our lives. It's easy to assume that we will always have these people, but it takes losing them to realize how wrong we really are. If you take things for granted you are missing out on the little things. Once you start to realize that tomorrow isn't guarenteed you won't be so quick to procrastinate. So be grateful for everyone and everything you have in your life, as you truly are lucky to have them.</p>
    <p class="my-class">I don't know what I would do without music. It helps keep me focused, lets me keep a level head when things arent going as planned. listening to music helps not only the mind but the soul. </p>
    <p class="my-class">Visualization can help get your brain on the right path to help set things in motion. In other words if you set your goals, and visualize accomplishing them, it's likely in time with hard work everything will start behaving in a way consistent with the images in your mind. This helps give a more clear vision of what it is you really want. Start small you can't acheive the big picture instantly, completing the small goals help so your not only waiting around for the big one.</p>
    <p class="my-class">Writing out affirmations is a way of taking all the doubts out of your mind, and fueling your goals with success. Doubting yourself will be the biggest resistor to your goals, once they are cut out and replaced with belief your goals will turn into reality. The beliefs have to match your desires, and your concious and unconcious mind will kick in working together to pave the way for your success.</p>
    <p class="my-class">Last but not least is probably the most well known principles. With risks come rewards. Taking risks to achieve goals takes courage to face the fear of uncertainty. And taking risks isn't always about the reward, its about the process. Whatever the outcome turns out to be, you grow becoming more confident in yourself. Which in turn helps push you take more risks only improving your chances of achieving your goals.</p>
